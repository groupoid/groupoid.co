                    This page is dedicated to the <a href="https://ncatlab.org">ncatlab</a> collaboration project.
                    Groupoid Infinity is a group of mathematicians who develop
                    the cubical base library to all main cubical type checkers
                    (cubicaltt, Arend, Agda, Lean), the home page of the project
                    is <a href="https://cubical.systems">cubical.systems</a>.
                p.
                    The main aim is to provide formal HoTT foundations for contemporary
                    math and have fun. Some parts are so new, that we need a help of
                    strong mathematicians, e.g. our areas of interests: Sheaf Theory,
                    Infinity Category Theory, Differential Geometry, Cohesive Type
                    Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Homology, and Cohomology Theory,
                    Geometric Type Theory. Most of us are Russian speaking guys,
                    guided by the following literature:

                p.
                    Our proposal is following. We want to provide $400/month budged
                    to volunteers helping us clarify topics that are not yet
                    presented at ncatlab or topics that need to be clarified
                    in the direction of our interests. We are talking about very
                    foundations, not the Fields Medal caliber. E.g. we lack de
                    Rham cohomology based formal foundation of classical calculus,
                    for the first year graduate students. But you can pick any
                    topic from our area of interests.
                p.
                    Your responsibility will be to provide necessary math foundation
                    in a form of ncatlab pages, so we can grab this information and
                    formalize it in cubical type checkers. Please consider this as
                    an art project, despite the cutting edge mathematics we are
                    dealing with. Also, please consider this as a regular contribution to ncatlab,
                    just founded by Groupoid Infinity. Our main motivation is to spread contemporary
                    math around the world and to help students who want to deal
                    with cubical type checkers. As a side effect, we are expecting
                    you to have fun as we do along the way.
