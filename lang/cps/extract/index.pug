        h2#erlang Interpreters
        p.
            From a practical point of view, we develop Erlang with Dependent Types.
            Thus we carefully integrate with Erlang platform by generating Erlang AST
            and trying to be compatible with Erlang kernel through mapping of inductive types
            to underlying Erlang primitives such as process, receive, and spawn.
            Erlang extraction is sponsored and supported by Synrc Research Center.
            Extraction in other languages could also be easily implemented.

        h2#llvm LLVM
        p.
            Another branch of research is dedicated to evaluation of LLVM lambda generation.
            It could be direct MIR or LLVM generation, or we could generate Rust/C++ code that
            could be passed to LLVM optimizer. If you are interested in LLVM target, please take a look
            at <a href="http://github.com/nponeccop/HNC">github.com/nponeccop/HNC</a>.

        h2#fpga FPGA
        p.
            We are very interested in compilation to FPGA.
            As was shown with interaction nets it is possible to compact
            packaging of inductive construction in silicon, giving back
            the inner language of space to the natural encoding.
            If you are interested in moving this project forward
            and have a vision how to do it please drop us a line in
            <a href="http://gitter.im/groupoid/exe">gitter.im/groupoid/exe</a> chat.
