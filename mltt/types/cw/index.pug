                    contains basic theorems about general theory of CW-complexes.

            section
                h1 Introduction
                p.
                    CW-complexes are fundamental objects in homotopy type theory
                    and even included inside cubical type checker as higher (co)-inductive types.
                    Just like regular (co)-inductive types could be described as recursive
                    terminating or non-terminating trees, higher inductive types could be
                    described as CW-complexes. Usually what you build in cubical type checker
                    as an inductive type with equalities means you define some CW-complex
                    directly using cubical homogeneous composition structure as an
                    element of initial algebra inside cubical model.

                    <b>Definition</b> (Attachment). Attaching n-cell to a space $X$
                    along a map $f : S^{n-1} \rightarrow X$ means taking a pushout
                figure.
                    $$
                    \begin{array}{ccc}
                        S^{n-1} & \mapright{\mathbf{f}} & X \\
                        \mapdown{} & & \mapdown{} \\
                        D^n & \mapright{} & X \cup_f D^n \\
                    \end{array}
                    $$
                p.
                    where the notation $X \cup_f D^n$ means result depends
                    on homotopy class of $f$.
                p.
                    <b>Definition</b> (CW-Complex). Inductively. The only
                    CW-complex of dimention $-1$ is $\varnothing$.
                    A CW-complex of dimension $\leqslant n$ on $X$ is a
                    space $X$ obtained by attaching a collection of n-cells
                    to a CW-complex of dimension $nâˆ’1$.
                p.
                    A CW-complex is a space $X$ which is the colimit(X_i) of a
                    sequence $X_{-1} = \varnothing \incmap X_0 \incmap X_1 \incmap X_2 \incmap ... X$ of
                    CW-complexes $X_i$ of dimension $\leqslant n$, with $X_{i+1}$
                    obtained from $X_i$ by i-cell attachments.
                    Thus if X is a CW-complex, it comes with a filtration
                    $$
                        \varnothing \incmap X_0 \incmap X_1 \incmap X_2 \incmap ... X
                    $$
                    where $X_i$ is a CW-complex of dimension $\leqslant i$ called
                    the i-skeleton, and hence the filtration is called the skeletal
                    filtration.
